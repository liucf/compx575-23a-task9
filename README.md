# COMPX575- Task Nine
Due on **Friday the 12th of May at midday**.

# Assignment Goal
* Gain experience using Android Studio
* Create a simple user interface for a Contact List application

## Preamble
1. Fork this repository using the button at the top of the project page.
2. Make sure that the visibility of your project is private. (Settings > expand Permissions > Project visibility: Private; Save changes).  *Note: Class teachers and tutors will still have read access to your project for marking purposes.*
3. Clone the new repository to your computer using Git.  Store the repository in your COMPX575 directory.
4. Remember to commit and push regularly as you work on the project!  
5. If you are remotely logging into the linux labs then you can run Android Studio with the command **/opt/bin/studio**

## Task Specification
The instructions for this assignment are provided in *Android Exercises.pdf*

The following are some additional hints:
* The emulator does not need to be closed each time.  If you stop your program, with your IDE, then running the program again later will be faster (as the emulator does not need to restart).
* The emulator itself has controls for rotating.
* If you copy code from the PDF, do so manually as using copy/paste functionality from a PDF often introduces funny characters.
* The shortcut key CTRL + ALT + L will autoformat your code, making it easier to read.
